# agnoster.zsh-theme

A ZSH theme optimized for people who use:

- Solarized
- Git
- Unicode-compatible fonts and terminals (I use iTerm2 + Menlo)

## What does it show?

- Success (✔) or failure (✘) of previous command
- Hostname
- Git status
  - Branch (⭠) or detached head (➦)
  - Current branch / SHA1 in detached head state
  - Dirty working directory (±, color change)
- Working directory
- Elevated (root) privileges (⚡)

## Future Work

I don't want to clutter it up too much, but I am toying with the idea of adding RVM (ruby version) and n (node.js version) display.
